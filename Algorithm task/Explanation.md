#User Interface
There are field for  maximum number of the array,
a field for insert new number to the array, and start button for the program
#Algorithm
In JS code i declarate variables for all UI components.
Then i convert to integer user given numbers from the fields.
Then i declarate one array for user input and one array for output results and  N counter  variable
with default value 0 . Then in annonymous function linked  to the start button the program start.
In for loop from 0 to inputarr lenght i add new number to the input array. Then  i increment with one
counter variable. Then I declarate variable for middle of the input array, and the output variables.
Then I checked the case if N is even  i set to  variable for first middle. It index is middle variable.
I declarate a new variable for second middle of input array which value is the increment of first
  middle variable. Then the firstoutput variable is equals firstmiddle+second middle/2
  Else if N is odd i take the first middle variable and round it to greater number and finaly i add
  first and second output variables to the array. And display the output array to the screen.
