##Used Languages:
FrontEnd -> HTML,CSS,JS
BackEnd -> PHP
Used framework -> AngularJS
Used IDE: NetBeans
##Application Logic
FrontEnd logic
My strart application page is index.html in public_html folder.
It's a SinglePage application with AngularJS that i used  for the menu. 
AngularJS is included localy in index.html file.
From User right menu user can access Register page and Login Page
When user register himself, a new object with him data is created and added to the array when user is logged successfuly he can access InnerPage with main functions AddUser,RemoveUser,ListUser,EditUser
BackEnd Logic
I choose PHP for server-side because of Information security 
in case if i used JS for user outhentication and basic application functions this is risk for the user data -> </br> the user can turn off the JS support of his browser and all application logic will be failed.
